This library is an Android library written in Kotlin that provides a flexible way to display and interact with selectable lists inside a BottomSheet. It is designed to simplify the creation of modern, user-friendly selection UIs by handling common patterns such as item selection, search filtering, and icon customization out of the box. Developers can easily integrate it into their projects to present option lists, filters, or menu items in a clean, Material-compliant BottomSheet interface.
